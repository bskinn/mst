Application of a thermal spike grain growth model reveals that the nanostructure in the doped alloy plateaus to a much finer grain size relative to predictions for pure tungsten, indicating that doping for enhanced thermal stability also stabilizes the material against irradiation instabilities.", "prez_name": "Uncovering the Effect of Grain Boundary Dopants on Irradiation Induced Grain Growth Through In Situ Microscopy", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/27C66D7CEBD6FA748525869F0056EAF0?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Advanced Characterization of Materials for Nuclear, Radiation, and Extreme Environments", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/8120C058BE84EF6885258593005EADC2?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=B6C7F14C3E2EE67A852584D3004B3D35"}, "407": {"prez_authors": "Simerjeet  Gill", "prez_abstract": "\nUnderstanding the factors that control solubility and speciation of metal ions in molten salts is key for their successful deployment in molten salt reactors (MSR).

The Cu precipitation was also observed. Although the precipitation of the Mo-rich \u03bc-phase occurred at higher annealing temperature, the alloy was softened due to the recrystallization.

High-throughput corrosion tests combined with metallurgical and chemical characterizations are employed to understand how bio-feedstocks encourage corrosion by identifying mechanisms linked to the intrinsic and extrinsic properties. The hydrolysis of triglycerides and the formation of free fatty acids in the bio-feedstock results in large carbon-rich aggregates at the surface, accelerated metal corrosion,  which together give rise to carbon-rich corrosion products.

By using persistent homology to study the size of certain algebraic topological features, we observe similarities to the length scales associated with the well-known first sharp diffraction peak in the studied glasses.", "prez_name": "Looking for Order in Disorder: Topological Data Analysis of Glass Structure", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/81F8A8A95E7F2E118525868E00742194?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Ceramics and Glasses Modeling by Simulations and Machine Learning", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/FFBF664FE1EDA3808525857B00244CED?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=B6C7F14C3E2EE67A852584D3004B3D35"}, "592": {"prez_authors": "Taihao  Han, Xinyi   Xu, Jie  Huang, Albert A.

These data enable connections to crystal plasticity models representing the evolution of morphology, crystallography, and anisotropy. In this work, we investigate the deformation-induced martensitic transformation in metastable austenitic Fe-Cr-Ni alloys using in situ HEDM during tensile loading. We track the microstructure evolution and grain-averaged strain tensors, and use these data to inform and validate a crystal plasticity model that accounts for the activation of dislocation-driven and transformation-induced deformation mechanisms and volumetric changes.

Using NiTi shape memory alloy and metastable beta Ti-alloy as examples, we show that mechanical twinning and phase transformations are intrinsically coupled in the symmetry-breaking processes, which results in multiple interconnected transformation and deformation pathways and characteristic twinning modes.

Superelastic nitinol wires, often used for the fabrication of stents, exhibit recoverable strains that are significantly greater than traditional alloys. This property arises from the transformations between the two phases, austenite and martensite, that it adopts near room temperature. In most of its applications, nitinol is cycled between these two phases, which results in functional and/or structural fatigue that ultimately leads to failure. It has been shown that the main fatigue crack initiation sites, other than surfaces, are microstructural inhomogeneities such as voids and non-metallic inclusions.

While CELIV has successfully assisted the design of virtually all of the new photoactive energy materials developed over the last decade (including photoconductive polymers and perovskites) it has been often used as one-data point measurements, with significant limitations on the information that can be extracted. Here, we will review the advantages of CELIV for designing high-mobility photoactive semiconductors and demonstrate how our group has integrated this technique with super-resolution microscopy  to extend this method for cross-sectional and mapping purposes in commercial energy materials.", "prez_name": "Charge Extraction by Linearly Increasing Voltage (CELIV): From One-data Point Measurement to Mobility Mapping in Solar Energy Materials", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/C99B068A538E8C848525869200224134?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Energy Materials for Sustainable Development", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/C72CF870A8DB39EE85258574006D250D?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=B6C7F14C3E2EE67A852584D3004B3D35"}, "734": {"prez_authors": "Yuri  Grin", "prez_abstract": "\nThe composition-crystal structure-properties relationships are substantial information sources for the development of materials.

Along with a general mathematical solution, the EDL structure is presented in various materials that are thermodynamically stable in contact with a lithium metal anode: the solid electrolyte Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) and the solid interlayer materials LiF, Li2O and Li2CO3.

Nevertheless, these studies have not been expanded to telluride glasses and solution-based production of telluride glasses with wide infrared optical windows have not yet been reported in the literature. The focus of the study was to bridge this gap by investigating the viability of producing a germanium arsenic telluride chalcogenide glass from solution. The chemical composition, structure, and transmission of the solution-processed telluride sample were measured. The solution-processed sample was found to maintain nearly identical stoichiometry and structure to the source glass, suggesting that the optical properties of the starting glass may also be retained in the solution-processed sample.

Based on these findings, it is argued that the dislocations are generated and migrate during sintering resulting in plastic flow. This becomes possible by the high heating rates, which conserve high driving forces for sintering up to high temperatures by minimizing neck growth at lower temperatures.

An Schmid factor-based activity index is defined to capture the number of slip system likely to be operating. The magnitude of YPP shows a linear correlation with this activity index. Furthermore, a general mesoscale (GM) model that incorporates internal stress generation into a standard crystal plasticity (CP) model, predicts the observations without any fitting to the experimental data (beyond the standard CP hardening parameters).

Ordinary Al2O3-C refractories are produced from dense corundum aggregates. According to traditional concept, the denser the refractories, the higher the strength of refractories. However, we proposed a novel strategy to enhance the strength of Al2O3-C refractories by using microporous corundum aggregates instead of dense ones. The lightweight Al2O3-C refractories combining the approach of using microporous aggregates and formation of SiC whiskers inside of microporous aggregates demonstrated an optimized bonding at the aggregate/matrix interface, which significantly enhanced their strength. On this basis, we found that using the carbon source with a higher reactivity resulted in more SiC whiskers in the microporous aggregates. The higher amount of SiC whiskers led to a more intertwined and compacter microporous aggregate/matrix interface structure.

With a lower melting temperature than most structural metals, and a Hexagonal Close-Packed atomic structure, the behavior of many wrought magnesium alloys is highly dependent on temperature and loading direction. This research investigates the behavior of AZ31 sheet under quasi-static monotonic tensile loading to understand the effects of  temperature and orientation on failure mechanisms. Specimens are manufactured in the longitudinal and transverse directions to evaluate the effects of texture. A microstructural analysis characterizes the distribution of grain size, particles, and critical defects in each direction. Tests are run at room temperature, 100 &#176C, and 200 &#176C for both texture orientations. A constitutive damage model is implemented which incorporates the effects of microstructure and temperature to characterize material behavior and failure mechanisms. </font></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr

We report x-ray-diffraction data on the xenotime/monazite phase transition in DyPO4, finding that transformation begins at 9.1 GPa, compared to Raman-spectroscopy-derived pressure of 13-15 GPa, calling into question the relevance of a historically observed trend across the lanthanide series. We intentionally vary the hydrostaticity, showing that a high shear environment lowers the DyPO4 transition onset pressure to 7 GPa.

Investigations on the structural and compositional development of the prepared coatings are conducted via Raman spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to determine the cross-linking and pyrolysis behavior, uniformity, and crack-free preparation of the coating films. The molecular structure of the preceramic polymers as well as the thermomechanical properties of the resulting Si(B)CN significantly influenced the quality of the coatings. Further thermal characterization suggested the potential of ceramic coatings in high temperature applications.", "prez_name": "Synthesis of Precursor Derived Si(B)CN Ceramic Coating for High-temperature Applications", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/7B37C9CFFC6261358525869600761DD1?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Preceramic Polymers; Synthesis, Processing, Modeling, and Derived Ceramics", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/1D3C140BB7834B86852585770065063D?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=B6C7F14C3E2EE67A852584D3004B3D35"}, "1280": {"prez_authors": "Kara L.

CMCs can be fabricated through polymer infiltration and pyrolysis (PIP), which requires repetition for full part densification due to porosity formed from polymer thermolysis. Addition of inorganic fillers can offset porosity but the dispersion rheology can be poor due to particle aggregation. Grafting polymers to fillers is a dependable method for stabilizing polymer/particle mixtures, but is an unexplored area for preceramic polymers.

However, if they stack radially, which can occur under an applied load, they provide a preferred fracture path. Our phase field model predicts the hydride morphology observed experimentally and identifies the mechanisms responsible for nanoscale hydride stacking. The model accurately predicts experimentally-observed elongated nanoscale hydride shape and the stacking of hydrides along the basal plane of the hexagonal zirconium matrix.

Using the alloy Ti-6Al-4V, the first of these problems has been solved by use of dilute alloying, added to increase the freezing range and so the probability of solutal undercooling during the rapid solidification experienced in AM. Interestingly, the addition of 3%Fe to Ti-64 changes the nature of the alloy from an alpha/beta alloy to a metastable beta Ti alloy. This allows for heat-treatments that are different from those applied to Ti-64, and involve exploitation of structural and compositional instabilities to produce refined microstructures uisng heat-treatments that do not make use of rapid quenching from a temperature above the beta transus.

Even during their dissolution, amorphous silicate phases precipitate on their surfaces with no consideration to the thermodynamically stable crystalline end points. Thermodynamics influences all materials, however \u2013 even ones as favorable to metastable states as glasses. This talk will explore how improved understanding of thermodynamics in glass systems can help to enable smart materials development and improved models for performance.", "prez_name": "Thermodynamics in the Design and Performance of Glass", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/BED7B08F20864A9B852586AA0031328B?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Thermodynamics of Materials in Extreme Environments", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/154E5C3109E2902C85258579006534E7?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=B6C7F14C3E2EE67A852584D3004B3D35"}, "1442": {"prez_authors": "Ping  Yang, Xiaobin  Zhang, Morgan  Kelley, Jason  Baker, Hakim  Boukhalfa, Artaches  Migdissov, Hongwu  Xu", "prez_abstract": "\nNuclear energy represents a critical means to ensure sustainable energy supplies and curb greenhouse gas emissions.  However, the development of nuclear energy systems is still hampered by safety concerns associated with the handling, processing, and disposing of spent fuel and high-level waste. One leading candidate approach is the storage of spent fuel in geological repositories.  The behavior of actinides in high P-T environments is a fundamental knowledge gap with little understanding of complexation and thermodynamics of 5f-elements at geothermal relevant P-T conditions of these proposed disposing facilities.  In this talk, we will present the impact on the chemical species and their thermodynamics from the elevated temperature and pressure based on the first-principle methods.  The predicted results were validated by experimental Raman and XAS measurements in a hydrothermal diamond-anvil cell.  The close integration between theory and experiment is the key to push forward the understanding of f-element chemistry at hydrothermal conditions.", "prez_name": "Thermodynamics of An-Cl Complexes at High Temperature and Pressure ", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/11B631C14D06ED96852586A900103921?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Thermodynamics of Materials in Extreme Environments", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/154E5C3109E2902C85258579006534E7?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=B6C7F14C3E2EE67A852584D3004B3D35"}, "1443": {"prez_authors": "Can  Agca, Jake W.

Reactor design and control in MSRs requires deep understanding of the fluoride and chloride salts proposed as the fuel heat transfer fluid. Thermophysical properties of these salts have been studied experimentally at different temperatures. In this study, binary fluoride and chloride system properties have been estimated using the Redlich-Kister model. Reference density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity data have been employed in a nonlinear regression technique using MATLAB curve fitting algorithms. Coupled with thermodynamics (CALPHAD), successful models will pave way in the estimation of ternary and higher molten salt systems and assist MSR technology development.
