This can be achieved through a suitable selection of synthesis routes and shaping techniques by optimizing the rheological properties of the suspensions in combination sometimes with fast sintering techniques in order to reach high denisficaties and to preserve the nanostructure. In this talk some examples of the feasibility of colloidal processing in the manufacture of laminates and nanostructured composites are shown, such as the manufacture of multilayer composites designed by combination of ferroelectric and ferromagnetic lead-free phases and the optimization of fuel cell components, emphasizing the direct effect of rheological properties on the mcrostructural features of the sintered materials.

To be sure, the first quarter of this year was a tumultuous time of extremes in the response to the more formally named, SARS-CoV2. As I write this abstract, it would be foolish to try to reflect over what the world has been through this Spring 2020.  For example, the actual pandemic numbers are still being developed at this point and will most likely not be fully articulated for several years much less the emotional angst imposed by talking about the many fatalities.  However, amid the chaos at the height of the pandemic, there are emerging some notions of the truth. The quarantining and virtually world-wide economic shutdown will be debated for decades, but there are reasons for optimism for the human condition. The drastically altered supply chains for food, as one example, were stretched but did not break. Personal protective equipment, in short supply early in 2020, was replaced by repurposing manufacturing in various factories, large and small, throughout the world. No longer unsung heroes, disparate jobs from medical care givers and first responders to grocery store workers and long haul truckers were recognized for the absolutely essential role they served to keep our human society whole during this crisis.

This research tested nickel-based alloys and one austenitic stainless steel in a KCl\u2014MgCl2 eutectic mixture at 700\u00b0C with redox control of the eutectic chloride salt as a method for reducing material degradation and studied what impact such a method may have on material properties of exposed alloys.

More than 98% dense specimens were prepared with conventional powder metallurgy using BaZr0.9Y0.1O2.95 (BZY) and BaZr0.955Y0.03Co0.015O2.97 (BZYC) powder. Cross-sectional T concentration profile of cut specimens showed that more T was diffused into BZY near-surface compared to BZYC.

The ultrashort pulse duration minimizes heat damage, and laser milling is performed in an isolated chamber to avoid main chamber contamination.  Combined with imaging and analytics (EBSD, EDS), this platform offers tremendous opportunities for rapid, multi-scale material analysis and targeted, sub-surface investigation.

The model is then used to explore how fluctuations within glass-forming systems impact the distribution of glass structural units, the ability of atoms to self-organize in adaptable network topologies, the thermodynamic properties of the system, heat capacity, and a glass-forming system\u2019s ability to nucleate crystals.", "prez_name": "Beyond the Average: Fluctuations in Glass-forming Systems", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/A9652C536F006EF68525852100772E08?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Ceramics and Glasses Simulations and Machine Learning", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/F70F89146BDF12AF8525841B0069C419?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=EB8595226BB57C208525831F00014E65"}, "377": {"prez_authors": "Stefano  Curtarolo", "prez_abstract": "\nCritical understanding of large amount of data exposes the unavoidability of disorder and leads to new descriptors for discovering entropic materials.

To address this problem, different sequential coating methods were employed to sensitize SnO2 nanowires (NWs) and Sb-SnO2 NWs and the effect of the sequential coating sequence and NW electric conductivity on PEC performance was examined. In comparison to the traditional radial sequential coating (RSC), longitudinal sequential coating (LSC) increased the photocurrent density of coated NWs by 30 %. Since high energy and low energy photons are absorbed by different parts of NWs, the improvement of the photocurrent is attributed to higher conversion rate and low thermalization loss of high energy photons to electricity in LSC NWs. Our recent study shows that the sequential coating of different bandgap sensitizers along the longitudinal direction on highly conductive NWs paves a way toward highly efficient solar-fuel conversion.

Of particular interest is the concentration dependent behavior under these conditions. At low concentrations, solvent-particle interactions are typically dominant, causing thermophoresis to occur and thereby impacting rheological behavior. Conversely, at higher concentrations particle-particle interactions will begin to dominate, limiting thermophoresis which may lead to emergent behavior from the induced thermal stress.

Am. Chem. Soc. 1929]. These rules apply whether disorder is induced intrinsically (e.g., chemical substitution), extrinsically (high temperature), or even by highly non-equilibrium conditions (high-energy ion irradiation and mechanical milling). These results provide a framework that can be utilized to predict the atomic configuration in disordered materials, including those that result from exposure to extreme conditions [O\u2019Quinn et al., In review, Nat.

Up until this point, there have been no rigorous theories established to predict these statistical distributions. Glass properties have traditionally been represented as mean values, which do not fully represent the complexity of glass structure. This paper introduces a rigorous approach for quantifying fluctuations in glass structure which will enable scientists to improve their understanding of fundamental glass physics and chemistry.

After 20 HPT-rotations, the Cu matrix and Cu5Zr phase were significantly refined and formed the lamellar structure having the average lamellar spacing of 15 nm. The ultimate tensile strength significantly increased and reached the saturation value of 1660 MPa after 50 HPT-rotations.

Substitution of calcium phosphates ceramic with alternative cations, such as magnesium, coupled with condensed phosphate ions plays a significant role in the bone remodeling process, affecting the early-stage of bone regeneration through stimulating osteogenic differentiation, prohibiting osteoclastic activity, and transforming into mechanically enhanced hydroxyapatite bone tissues. Osteoconductivity of the implants and sufficient strength are also achieved by obtaining a macroporous material with a specific architecture, in which pores are connected.

Because regeneration rate cannot be predicted prior to biomaterial implantation, there is a need for responsive biomaterials with adaptive, personalized degradation rates to improve regenerative outcomes. Our research demonstrates an approach to use therapeutic ultrasound to alter the degradation profile of silk fibroin biomaterials noninvasively, post-implantation. By evaluating changes in weight, porosity, surface morphology, compressive modulus, and chemical structure, we conclude that therapeutic ultrasound can induce degradation of silk scaffolds. Furthermore, the scaffold\u2019s mechanical properties and polymer structure were not altered during sonication. This method proved safe for human cells with no negative effects on cell viability or metabolism. Sonication through human skin also effectively triggered scaffold degradation, increasing the clinical relevance of these results.

HSPT has been shown to produce excellent tensile and fatigue properties, but has a hierarchical structure with coarse prior \u03b2 grains, which may limit performance.  This study aimed to examine non-deformation-based means to refine the prior \u03b2 grains in order to further improve mechanical properties. To this end, various quenching and heat treatments were incorporated into HSPT.
