Three main technological features have beendiscussed in terms of (1) partial sintering with a suitable amount of sintering additive, to control nano-sized porosity during sintering, (2) the use of ice crystals, as sacrificial pore formers, formed by freezing raw particle dispersed gel bodies, leading to ultrahighly porous ceramic components after sublimating ice crystals by vacuum drying and subsequently sintering, and (3) various blowing techniques for molten preceramic polymers or powder compacts to provide spherical porosities. This presentation intends to give an overview of their distinctive characteristics such as fluid permeability, mechanical strength, machinability, electrochemical performance, piezoelectric property and thermal conductivity of the produced ceramic components with varied morphology and compositions. In addition, the relationship between the microstructure and mechanical/thermal properties has been discussed using a multiscale modeling technique, in which a homogenization method has been conducted with microscopic models created from three dimensional images, collected by X-ray computed tomography (CT) and stress or temperature distributions in macroscopic samples by finite element method. The simulation results have been well consistent with the experimental results, suggesting that this modeling technique can be thus confirmed to become a strong tool for the prediction of the mechanical or thermal properties of porous ceramics.

This lecture will provide fundamental insights and describe approaches to realizing non-equilibrium nanomaterials via solid state transformations of ceramics. Solid state transformations, where one crystalline phase is converted to another through, for example, reassembly of carbon atoms of SiC to form graphene, nanotube arrays or porous carbide-derived carbons (CDC); and removal of atomic planes of layered carbides and nitrides known as MAX phases to form 2D carbides and nitrides (MXenes), such as Mo2C, Ti3C2, Nb4C3, Ti4N3 and other, offer opportunities to produce nanoscale structures with atomic precision. More than 30 different MXenes have been synthesized since 2011, not counting solid solutions. CDC and MXene can be produced at room or slightly elevated temperature, while graphene and nanotubes require higher temperatures. We aim to understand transformative synthetic processes that alter or direct the crystal structure at the unit cell level, such as selective extraction, atomic exchange, and intercalation, and use this knowledge to develop new nanomaterials. The far-from-equilibrium nature of many of these transformations allows for the realization of metastable structures by kinetically avoiding equilibrium phases, such as graphite or bulk carbide. Solid state transformations or selective etching processes can lead to numerous nanomaterials with outstanding physical properties, such as high strength and metallic conductivity. Additionally, the relatively low energy input needed to carry out the synthesis reduces the barriers to translating new material breakthroughs from the lab to industry. The ability to control the number of atomic layers and surface chemistry opens opportunities for fine tuning of properties. New nanomaterials realized through elementally-targeted extraction and exchange reactions can be built with atomic-level precision offering novel and well-controlled properties.

However, due to the weak interfacial interaction and limited inclusion filling ratio, electromechanical performance of the additive manufactured piezoelectric nanocomposite demonstrated by previous literature is significantly lower than the theoretical upper bound. To solve this, we introduced surface functionalization of piezoelectric inclusion to the additive manufactured nanocomposite. The electromechanical property of piezoelectric composite is enhanced through strong interfacial interaction and highly-loaded well-dispersed inclusion. Over 10 times increasement of piezoelectric charge constants are achieved through functionalization with specific inclusion filling ratios, approaching the theoretical upper bound of electromechanical property. Additionally, the electromechanical property of the piezoelectric nanocomposite is further increased by tuning the morphology of the inclusion and the matrix stiffness.

The custom direct ink writing system has two modules, the print head and the feed system, and interfaces with a commercially-available, desktop 3D printer.  The feed system inputs ink to the print head, which uses an auger to mix and extrude material from a single nozzle.  This system has several advantages over syringe-based direct ink write systems, which have poor stop-start extrusion control, rheology dependent extrusion rates, require syringe changes for multi-material prints, and printing composition gradients is not possible without in-line mixing.

Correlations of porosity measurements between traditional metallographic sectioning of powder samples and CT values are made to ensure the validity of each type of analysis to better inform AM feedstock characterization methods and thus build quality.

Based on the above paradigm, recent developments have experimentally confirmed that modest changes in the polarizability of local structure, which is induced by the A site donor dopants, such as rare earth Sm3+, can be regarded as \u201cseeds\u201d to further enhance the dielectric properties of ABO3 perovskite solid solutions.

In part due to the constraints associated with these nano-grained microstructures, non-ferroelectric dielectric materials (e.g. calcium copper titanate, CCTO) and relaxor ferroelectric-based (bismuth sodium titanate, BNT-based) films were studied. Deposition was performed onto metal substrates to facilitate the characterization of the electrical properties of the films; including permittivity as a function of temperature.  In this talk we present the structural, dielectric, and ferroelectric properties of these films - including the effect of various processing parameters.

The delay time is important in understanding the transport and nucleation behavior. A new approach to measure \u03c4 has been developed by analyzing the glass transition temperature, Tg shift via high rate calorimetry (Flash DSC). In alloys exhibiting primary crystallization with the increase of annealing time (ta), Tg shifts to higher temperatures in the Tg vs. ta plot and there appears a break point in slope. Before the break point, Tg shifts due to relaxation. After the break point, the precipitation of nanocrystals induces a composition change so that Tg shifts because of both relaxation and  composition change effects.

In particular, transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy can reveal the kinetic pathways of photoexcited species that dictate the function of photovoltaic and light emitting materials, but TA is rarely performed in situ during materials formation. This is likely because TA typically requires many minutes to hours of data acquisition time, longer than the timescale of many materials formation processes. Here, we introduce a novel implementation of TA that can measure transients in just a few seconds.

Specifically, 76% humidity creates classical etched pits that are nominally hemispherical while 40% creates etched pits where attack occurs along distinct microstructural features that appear to be slip bands.  Additionally, SCC are found to initiate from pits at 40% RH only when only residual stresses are present.

In this work we seek to understand how stress concentration in complex AM geometries leads to cracking during sintering, with the goal of mitigating the problem. Experiments involving in situ analysis of 3D-printed samples during sintering reveal how sinter-cracks initiate and grow, revealing unexpected behavior. Discrete element simulations offer further insight by allowing direct measurement of the stresses in a sinter-cracking material.

U-10Mo samples as hot rolled (80% total reduction) and as cold rolled (10%, 30%, and 50% total reduction) were annealed at 600\u02daC and 700\u02daC for time periods ranging from 1-8 hours. Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD) was employed to observe and quantify recrystallization and grain growth in the samples. The effects of plastic deformation and annealing temperature control the nucleation and growth rates for recrystallization. Optimum conditions are identified to obtain specific grain size distributions.

We assume that we have multiple sources of information with varying degrees of fidelity as well as cost. The available information to all sources is fused through a reification approach and then a sequential experimental design is carried out.

One of the applications where this emerging discipline of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering is enabling improvement, is in the design, manufacture and sustainment of large, forged aluminum airframe components.  Within the past decade, a number of studies have been performed in which forging process modeling was used to predict bulk residual stresses in large aluminum airframe components.  These stresses were then used in structural design calculations (especially fatigue calculations) in order to demonstrate the impact that process induced bulk residual stresses can have on performance.  While this prior work included both modeled and measured residual stresses, it did not address the issue of uncertainty quantification.  In the work presented here, residual stress measurements were made on replicate machined parts, and the variability in the measurements was combined with an estimate of the measurement error to determine the overall uncertainty.  At the same time, forging process modeling along with Bayesian inference techniques were used to simulate both the expected mean and uncertainty in residual stress at the same locations where measurement data were available.  The uncertainties in both the measured and modeled residual stresses were then propagated through fatigue analyses in order to predict the dependence of fatigue life variability on residual stress variability.

The large surface area of SWCNTs increases the availability of active ion exchange sites of the AEP. This NanoResin has been characterized to understand structure-function/performance relationship for thin film membrane purification processes. NanoResin removes 95% of emerging contaminants from water efficiently at environmentally relevant concentration levels. Regeneration studies demonstrates that NanoResin could be regenerated without significant degradation. Hence, NanoResin is an effective and sustainable solution to water purification.

Alloying Mg with rare earth elements (REEs) results in improved mechanical properties and reduced degradation times. The commercial Mg implant (MAGNEZIX) has a high REE content and has demonstrated improved mechanical and degradation performances. However, concerns about the biosafety of REEs have been raised since there is no consensus on their safe dosage. We have fabricated RE free nanostructured Mg alloys containing nutrient elements such as zinc and calcium using novel non-equilibrium routes namely; rapid solidification followed by severe plastic deformation techniques.

First, the judicious introduction of free surfaces and elimination of grain boundaries in oligocrystalline structures has been found to substantially reduce cracking and enable shape memory properties in a variety of form factors, including particles, pillars, powder packings, foams, and even some bulk forms.  Second, tuning the crystallographic mismatch of the transformation by composition control has also led to reduction of mismatch stresses and promises further progress in the reduction of cracking.

Herein, we present two large DFT databases of solute segregation energy at the interface between the aluminum matrix and \ud835\udf03\u2032-Al2Cu and partitioning of solutes within \ud835\udf03\u2032 via special quasirandom structures (SQSs). We also report highly accurate semi-coherent Al/\ud835\udf03\u2032 interfacial energy at under-investigated (110) orientation.

However, atomistic-mechanisms responsible for such changes are still inadequately understood. Hence, a multimodal in situ chemical imaging approach of such changes on alloy surfaces during exposure to reactive gaseous environments at high temperature was performed. For selected model alloys, commercial Zralloys and Ti alloys at varying environmental conditions (e.g.pressure,temperature, gas exposure), we demonstrate the gas-induced change in structure of near-surface regions using in situ gas reaction-cell in transmission electron microscope (TEM). Furthermore, we demonstrate the changes to the composition of surface and sub-surface regions of the same alloy and exposure conditions in an environmental reaction chamber associated with atom probe tomography (APT).

A new class of cast Al-Cu-Mn-Zr (ACMZ) alloys was recently developed, which maintains microstructural stability up to 350 \u00b0C as opposed to 250 \u00b0C for commercial cast Al alloys. High coarsening resistance of the strengthening \u03b8\u02b9 precipitates in ACMZ alloys improves the mechanical properties and stability at elevated temperature. A higher Cu level is desirable in these alloys to attain superior hot tear resistance during casting. Here, we present a systematic study on the effect of Cu content (6-9 wt.%) on microstructure and mechanical behavior of ACMZ alloys after aging and long-term thermal exposure. The role of both intragranular \u03b8\u02b9 and intergranular \u03b8 precipitates in determining the tensile, low cycle fatigue and creep properties over a range of temperatures will be discussed.", "prez_name": "Role of Cu Content in Determining the Mechanical Behavior of Cast Al-Cu-Mn-Zr Alloys", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/65002D4239490F6A852583CB0076C2D7?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Ultra High Performance Metallic Systems for Aerospace, Defense, and Automotive Applications", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/67FC79298829BB128525829F0026CAB1?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=7E9C94165C3B857D852582340050B6D7"}, "2185": {"prez_authors": "Keerti S.

These components require superior low cycle fatigue (LCF) properties, however LCF capability can be limited if the surface and subsurface damage and/or tensile residual stress is introduced during manufacturing processes or in service.  The evolution of microstructure in Ni-based superalloys subjected to severe plastic deformation was investigated.  Samples were exposed to various milling conditions as well as high speed sliding. The microstructural refinement in the specimen surface and subsurface was dependent on processing conditions.  The deformation structure ranged from shear bands to micro- and nano-grains to partial amorphization of the outermost layer.

Fine grains, especially after cold working, would be unstable at thermal condition due to the probability of grain boundaries migration and a high density of twin and dislocation. Furthermore, post-annealing contributes to grains boundaries modification and dislocation rearrangement or annihilation that leads to grain size and texture modification. Thus, the dependency of microstructure and mechanical performance on thermal condition needs more attention.
