One of the main challenges in ceramic SLA is that support structures are required to build overhanging features. Since support structures have to be manually removed after fabrication, fracture tips are typically introduced at the location where a support structure was originally built. Fracture tips may decrease surface quality, introduce stress concentration and consequently increase the probability of component damage. In this research, we present a Suspension-Enclosing Projection-stereolithography process (SEPS), which employs the unique non-Newtonian rheological behavior of its high-viscosity feedstock material to self-support overhanging features without building extra support structures. Different feedstock materials are studied to identify the most suitable rheological properties required for supporting overhanging features.

They were mixed to slurry which was then procured in a water bath at 70 oC for 0-20 min.  The procured slurry was mixed with silicon powder and poured in a mold at 90 cC for three days.  \n\nAfter the synthesis, porous samples were obtained.  With increasing the water bath treatment time, open porosity was increased to 80%.  From this study, a synthesis method to control open porosity of geopolymer for hydrogen recombining catalyst supports was developed.

However there are many problems that must still be overcome before they are suitable for practical use. One of the main problems is fabricating a multilayer structure. Therefore lead-free potassium sodium niobate-based multilayer piezoelectric ceramics co-fired with nickel inner electrodes are studied. Nickel inner electrodes have many advantages, such as high electromigration resistance, high interfacial strength with ceramics, and greater cost effectiveness than silver palladium inner electrodes. However, widely used lead zirconate titanate-based ceramics cannot be co-fired with nickel inner electrodes, and silver palladium inner electrodes are usually used for lead zirconate titanate-based piezoelectric ceramics. A possible alternative is lead-free ceramics co-fired with nickel inner electrodes. We have thus been developing lead-free potassium sodium niobate-based multilayer ceramics co-fired with nickel inner electrodes. The normalized electric-field-induced thickness strain (Smax/Emax) of a representative potassium sodium niobate-based multilayer ceramic structure with nickel inner electrodes was 360 pm/V, where Smax denotes the maximum strain and Emax denotes the maximum electric field. This value is about half that for the lead zirconate titanate-based ceramics that are widely used. However, a comparable value can be obtained by stacking more ceramic layers with smaller thicknesses. Thus the developed potassium sodium niobate-based multilayer ceramic co-fired with nickel inner electrodes is a high potential candidate for use in lead-free piezoelectric devices.", "prez_name": "Potassium Sodium Niobate-based Multilayer Piezoelectric Ceramics Co-fired with Nickel Inner Electrodes", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/136BFA587CB2BFED8525824B0065A1B5?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "ACerS Richard M.

Current interest is therefore focused on materials of moderate elasticity, e.g. the metastable \u03b2-titanium and highly biocompatible Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta (TNZT) alloys. \nAdditive manufacturing (AM) provides vast potential for biomedical applications: it enables rapid production of three-dimensional parts with high level of precision and freedom in design.

In this study, post-process curing conditions of commercially available silver pastes with advanced carbon additions printed using a direct write system were evaluated to determine curing effects on conductivity. Printed silver pastes that were combined with conductive carbon additions were cured under a variety of temperatures and durations, as well as by photonic sintering. After curing the traces were characterized utilizing resistivity measurements by the four-probe method and microstructural evaluation using scanning electron microscopy. Effects of curing conditions on electrical properties and microstructure of printed silver inks will be presented.", "prez_name": "Post-process Curing Effects on Conductivity of Additively Manufactured Silver Pastes for Electric Motor Applications", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/19EAA476CC0A913E85258244006B6A47?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Additive Manufacturing of Metals: Post Processing", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/D6436AE38D95FF8E8525812B0071DC63?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=8B0BF2B4D6505BA8852580CF005B20F8"}, "209": {"prez_authors": "Franz-Josef  Villmer, Olaf  Elstermeyer", "prez_abstract": "\nAdditive Manufacturing (AM) can provide cost and time advantages compared to traditional approaches, although it still has some disadvantages in the post process.

Firstly, the design and alignment of the AM built part have to be adapted to surface quality requirements and the capabilities of SLM. Secondly, the SLM process itself has to be optimized, e.g. by reduction of layer thickness or variation of laser power or focus.

The sensing of interlayer defects that occur at the interface between the printed layers is particularly challenging. In-situ detection (monitoring) of defects during printing is more valuable than detection after completing the printing, because in-situ detection allows correction of the printing conditions during build-up of the 3D structure. Cameras are the most common method of monitoring, but they are not effective for detecting interlayer defects. This paper describes in-situ detection of interlayer and intralayer defects without using any sensor, as the structure being built is its own sensor.  The concept involves measuring the capacitance of the structure being built, using coplanar electrodes that are positioned on the buildplate.

Using measured thermophysical and electrocaloric property data for several promising perovskite-structured refrigerant materials, including barium titanate, lead magnesium niobate \u2013 lead titanate and barium zirconate-titanate, and a simple model based on Newtonian cooling, relationships exiting between the nature of the paraelectric to ferroelectric phase transition, the temperature variation of thermophysical properties, and electrocaloric behavior are illustrated and discussed.", "prez_name": "Factors Affecting the Electrocaloric Cooling Performance of Ferroelectric Perovskites", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/CEC175087F61EE368525825F00814D6E?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Advances in Dielectric Materials and Electronic Devices", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/32A2537190EEE5B1852581310048F2C5?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=8B0BF2B4D6505BA8852580CF005B20F8"}, "452": {"prez_authors": "Ducinei  Garcia, Fl\u00e1via Regina Estrada", "prez_abstract": "\nIn this work, structural, dielectric, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the (Pb1-xCax)TiO3 ceramics were characterized as a function of temperature considering compositions within the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) region, 0.375\u2264x\u22640.50.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate LME susceptibility during resistance spot welding of zinc-coated AHSS. The susceptibility to LME was analyzed using various base metal microstructures, and cracking severity was compared to mechanical joint performance. It was identified that susceptibility to LME increased when austenitic microstructures were present. However, less susceptible microstructures can still develop severe LME cracking with increased stress levels.

Two main sources of bottom dross formation are (1) excess iron dissolution from steel strip to the alloy boundary layer due to transient temperature and metallurgical conditions, and subsequent precipitation and growth of Fe-based intermetallic compounds (IMCs), and (2) bath temperature-perturbation-driven precipitation and growth of IMCs in the bulk alloy. In either case, IMCs that grow to a critical size will settle into the bottom of the bath to form bottom dross. This dynamic process is an unavoidable, although the formation of bottom dross is undesired. This study investigates the growth mechanism of the IMCs in suspension in an Al-Zn-Si-Mg coating alloy bath.

Four elements meet these criteria:  La, Ce, Sm and Gd.  Green and unfired terra cotta samples established statistical reliability.  The elemental ratios of brick (31 brick, 10 raw clay) and historical terra cotta (11 samples) were evaluated.  Of the 11 terra cotta samples, eight were grouped tightly indicating they were likely manufactured by the same company.

From the hardness-indentation strain rate data we estimate the shear stress and strain rates inside shear bands. Aging the glass near Tg increases flow stress but has a secondary effect on the slope of the stress-strain rate curve. This is indication that a back stress exists, which contributes to the measured hardness. We propose that the magnitude of this back stress is related to the stress required to initiate new shear bands. The result also suggests that deformation kinetics inside the shear band are independent of prior thermal history (consistent with loss of memory of the aged structure because of the large strains encountered inside shear bands). Individual stress-strain rate curves generated from BNC depend on deformation history, particularly initial rate of loading (the same thing is observed in amorphous polymers). Lastly, the stress-strain rate data generated from BNC, while broadly consistent with data obtained from other experimental methods, seem inconsistent with molecular dynamics simulations extrapolated to laboratory strain rates.

The truth is that the glassy state is transitory; the same processes that take place in a SCL above Tg also happen below it, but they become more and more sluggish as kinetic energy is removed from the system. In fact, at any temperature, this nonequilibrium configuration (called glass) spontaneously and steadily relax towards a metastable configuration of the supercooled liquid. While exploring this concept 70 years ago, Walter Kauzmann questioned what would happen if one could produce a supercooled liquid at temperatures way below Tg.

First, flow stress data of the steel from room temperature to 1200\u00b0 Celsius is generated by hot-tension testing in Gleeble\u00ae, where digital image correlation is used to accurately measure the true strain. Second, electrical contact resistance is described as a function of temperature and contact pressure using an existing formula in the literature. The resistance parameters are calibrated by comparing the calculated and measured nugget geometry in resistance spot welding of the same steel.

Thus, isotropic, kinematic and combined isotropic/kinematic hardening models are adopted in elastic-plastic finite element analysis of a beam and elbow in cyclic loading.

Sulfurization tests were carried out at different temperatures ranging from 600\u2070C to 1250\u2070C. XRD, XRF, ICP-MS and SEM-EDS were used for characterization. A silica crucible was used as a container placed in a tube furnace under argon gas to enhance the reaction. Nickel and Copper content in the slag were 0.75 and 1.16% respectively. The major phases were fayalite, cuprospinnel and nickel oxide. Results showed that the recycling of gypsum from hydrometallurgical plants was beneficial and the increase in temeperature favored to convert nickel oxide into sulphide. Peacks decomposition has proved a number of sulphides have formed. However, above 1100\u2070C the sulfurization degraded.", "prez_name": "Use of Waste Gypsum from Hydrometallurgical Plant for the Recovery of Nickel from a Nickel Slag by Sulfurization", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/F73EED75FFC82219852582510063A236?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Materials Property Understanding through Characterization", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/DC868D944F27B08485258131005D99B1?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=8B0BF2B4D6505BA8852580CF005B20F8"}, "1429": {"prez_authors": "Thomas  Zega, Venkat  Manga, Krishna  Muralidharan, Fred  Ciesla, Keitaro  Watanabe, Hiromi  Inada", "prez_abstract": "\nPrimitive chondritic meteorites contain mm- to cm-sized assemblages of Ca- and Al-bearing oxides and silicates.

However, ZrO2-based SMCs are currently restricted to micron-scale single-/oligo-crystals, as polycrystals crack after a few cycles. To improve the cyclability, we have explored the recently proposed cofactor conditions, which, if met, are hypothesized to improve crystallographic compatibility and minimize interface stresses associated with the martensitic transformation. We have calculated the cofactor conditions for a number of chemistries and predicted some preferred compositions. However, many of these compositions have transformations that occur at cryogenic temperatures and thus have not been well-studied. We have synthesized a number of these compositions and characterized the transformation for the first time down to cryogenic temperatures using in situ X-ray diffraction. The cofactor conditions are then calculated from measured lattice parameters and correlated to observed cracking during thermal cycling experiments.", "prez_name": "Study of the Cofactor Conditions in ZrO2-Based Shape-memory Ceramics", "prez_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/ApprovedAbstracts/69E1C41535A36CE485258250005953B1?OpenDocument", "symp_name": "Phase Transformations in Ceramics: Science and Applications", "symp_url": "http://www.programmaster.org/PM/PM.nsf/UpcomingSymposia/019E005912F003D38525810000640DDC?OpenDocument&ParentUNID=8B0BF2B4D6505BA8852580CF005B20F8"}, "1654": {"prez_authors": "Dan  Lowry, Pankaj  Sarin", "prez_abstract": "\nControlling the second order ferroelastic phase transformation in RENbO4 materials, from a low temperature monoclinic to a high temperature tetragonal phase, is of considerable interest for high temperature applications.

Powders of Zr4+ co-substituted RENbO4 (RE = La, Nd, Dy, and Y) were synthesized by stearic entrapment method for a range of Zr4+ compositions. Phase transformation was studied by in-situ XRD at high temperatures, and from changes in specific heat capacity.

An exact interrelation of these properties, however, escaped attention up to now. Our combined experimental high-pressure studies and ab initio calculations on these spinels allowed us to unravel the link between the structural and magnetic properties in these compounds, i.e. we show that the transition pressure is proportionally related to the magnitude of the Cr3+-Cr3+ magnetic exchange interactions active in these materials.

The observations on crystalline films suggested strain and time as important but overlooked factors in nucleation and growth of high pressure phases and provided new context to previous works published in this field. The experimental results on a-Si films linked with earlier studies established a three-step deformation sequence under indentation loading: reversible deformation, increase in coordination defects, and phase transformation. Estimated conditions for the occurrence of the different steps are given with respect to relevant intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, e.g. indentation strain and bond angle distribution.
